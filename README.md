### 1. General

The goal in this project was to use BTCD to validate invariants around validating the blockchain. The blockchain used was on a local simulated Bitcoin network (Simnet in BTCD) where we had multiple RPC servers running with different peers and underlying resources (e.g. databases) and to use executions from BTCD to determine where these invariants if any Bitcoin invariants were validated. The key thing to model is the communication of these servers in validating the longest blockchain to determine whether to keep or discard a transaction. This will involve creating dummy transactions and sending them to servers so they can be mined by peers.
